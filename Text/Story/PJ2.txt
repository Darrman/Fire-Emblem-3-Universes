## PJ2Narration
#Original script by mystletainn von eldigan
#PJ small banter by the stardust jaguars gang
#Chapter 2: Persecution
Almost two months have passed since the[N]
assassination of Vergil's parents.[AN]
During that time, the Purple Jaguars[N]
have found themselves attacked by[AN]
Arxhat's men on multiple occasions,[N]
forcing them to seek shelter in caves[AN]
and forests. Exhausted and downcast,[N]
Vergil is beginning to lose his drawn[AN]
-out fight to stay alive...[A][X]

## PJ2OpeningScouting

#Load Horus [FarLeft] and Daff [FarFarLeft]. Sme enters from off-screen to [MidRight].
#FarFar's are off-screen. Daff isn't shouting from off-screen, so I'll rearrange positioning to fit properly.

#Sme:
Horus, I'm back from scouting. I've[N]
located a cave due east of here.[A]

#Horus:
Thank you. I'm grateful for[N]
your hard work.[A]

[MR]
#Sme:
No, no, no! It's alright![N]
We all have to do our[AN]
part in this situation,[N]
right?[A]

#Daff moves to [Left]. - left already occupied by Horus

#[MoveMidLeft]

[FL]#Daff:
Still! What part is there to be done[N]
if you put yourself in an early[AN]
grave, and... well... You know what I[N]
mean! Please, be more careful...[AN]

[MR]#Sme
I'm fine, Daff. It's just... skulking[N]
around the forest, isn't it?[AN]

[Left]#Horus:
We can seek shelter[N]
in that cave and get[AN]
some much deserved[N]
respite.[A]

[FL]#Daff:
A cave again?[N]
Jeez... That makes[AN]
this the fifth[N]
time...[A]

[Left]#Horus:
It's better than nothing.[N]
Besides, considering the[AN]
recent attacks of Arxhat's[N]
search parties, I'm sure[AN]
most of us would appreciate[N]
some time to rest.[AN]
Especially him...[AN]

Don't be afraid of speaking[AN]

Do not be so aggressive, milord.[N]
I am but a... merchant of sorts.[AN]
I go by the name of Kabby. I am[N]
undoubtedly allied with you,[AN]
milord. In fact, as proof of my[N]
allegiance, I am willing to[AN]
share my humble abode with your...[N]

yourselves at home in my web,[N]
eheheh.[AN]

[FR]#Vergil:
...Your web?[A]

[Left]#Kabby:
 Hmm?[AN]
#[Jumps in place]
[MoveLeft]
Oh! Yes, these caves are[N]
called "the Web", due to[AN]
how they branch out. One[N]
could get lost quite[AN]
easily in here without a[N]
proper guide...[AN]

[FR]#Vergil:
Kabby. I appreciate your offer,[N]
but I'm not in the mood for[AN]
sugarcoating. If you're willing[N]
to give us a place to rest, so[AN]
be it. But, if I hear any word[N]
of you acting against us, you[AN]
won't live to regret betraying[N]
us. Understood?[AN]

[Left]#Kabby:
Your words wound me, Prince Vergil![N]
Though, as your humble servant, I[AN]
shall abide. Besides, it's about[N]
time to feed Bagel. He gets quite[AN]
rowdy when hungry, the little bugger.[N]
We should be visiting my home now![AN]

How is the situation at[N]

[Right]#Anton:
It's a really big mess, milord, but[N]
before I elaborate, would you[AN]
kindly tell your men to release me[N]
and my companion? I'd rather not[AN]
suffer any further injuries.[AN]

[ML]#Vergil:
Of course. At peace, friends.[A]

#Clear Xenith.

[Right]#Anton:
As I was saying... The capital is in[N]
turmoil, milord. I came as quickly[AN]
as I could. This is my companion,[N]
Khris. I was in need of a helping[AN]
hand throughout my journey. He can[N]
be trusted.[AN]

[FR]#Khris:
Oh, hi. Yeah, nice to[N]
meet you, I guess.[AN]

[ML]#Vergil:
Any help is appreciated, but what[N]
news can you tell me?[AN]

[FR]#Khris:
Well, uh... I'm not much for politics,[N]
my lord? But things got pretty heated[AN]
when the news came that the royal family[N]
was assassinated as soon as they left.[AN]

[Right]#Anton:
With news that the royals were gone,[N]
chaos ensued until Arxhat took the[AN]
throne by force in a coup. Initially,[N]
we were told that the entire royal[AN]
family was purged. We were relieved[N]
to hear that you had survived after all,[AN]
but... Arxhat claimed you were the one[N]
who killed your parents, with the aid[AN]
of the Novingale Empire.[AN]

[ML]#Vergil:
So, Arxhat uses Empress Aurea[N]
against me... that damned dastard.[AN]
Do you believe what he says?[AN]

[Right]#Anton:
#[Jumps in place]
Certainly not! If that were the case,[N]
I wouldn't be here in the first place.[AN]

[FR]#Khris:
No offense, my lord, but I've[N]
seen my fair share of killers[AN]
and murderers. You don't seem[N]
the type. This Arxhat, on the[AN]
other hand...[AN]

#Anton moves to [MidRight].

The countrymen are in need for[AN]
a proper leader, milord! As it is,[N]
things will only get worse.[AN]
We need your help![AN]

[ML]#Vergil:
Can I even do anything? Everyone[N]
else in that convoy... they're[AN]
all dead. Slaughtered like pigs.[N]
Arxhat's won. He has the entire[AN]
military at his disposal.[AN]

[Right]#Anton:
Milord... that's a whole lot of[N]
nonsense! You are the last[AN]
beacon for our people. While[N]
there may be those allied with[AN]
Arxhat, do know that there are[N]
still loyalists who do not[AN]
believe his lies![AN]

## PJ2BossQuotes

BOSS QUOTES:
BRUCKNER
Bruckner: Traitors to Seraphyn! You will fall beneath my blade of justice!

Bruckner v. Vergil
Bruckner: You are scum, Vergil! Killing your own parents? Allying with the bloody prince of Novingale? You have no right to rule!

Vergil: Do you really believe those lies Arxhat fed you, Bruckner? I am the crown prince, you fool. The rightful heir to the throne! Why would I kill my beloved family?

Bruckner: Arxhat warned me of your silver tongue, Vergil! I won't be swayed by your lies!

Vergil: Fine! Then die a deluded fool!

Bruckner v. Stephen
Bruckner: You! Traitor to the crown! You ally with these scum?

Stephen: I must be dreaming! You stole my lines!

Bruckner: Huh? What worthless drivel are you spouting now, sellsword?

Stephen: No, I see it now! You are a master actor, completely method as a remorseless villain. Unfortunately for you, your part is done. Time for you to go offstage!

Bruckner v. Kabby
Bruckner: You! You led us into a trap! Traitorous dog!

Kabby: Today has been an eventful one. You, them, I've switched sides twice, now? Unfortunately, staying with you won't help me achieve my end goal, so please die.

Bruckner v. Anton
Bruckner: A peasant? Hmph! So Vergil's words have brainwashed the common folk as well!

Anton: Brainwashed? I think you need to look into a mirror.

Bruckner v. Khris
Bruckner: You're another worthless sellsword?

Khris: Worthless? Please. That filthy mouth of yours will surely stop after one fell swoop from my blade.

Bruckner: Overconfident, are you? You'll meet your end, sellsword brat!

Death Quote
Bruckner: Arxhat... Vergil... Will someone save Seraphyn?

BEAR / Bagel
Vergil v. Bear
Vergil: Well, let's eat this bear!

Kabby: Wait, you want to eat MY bagel?! ...And people call me sick.

Kabby v. Bear

Kabby: I probably should have trained you after all. I'm sorry, my Bagel! I must crush you!

lurking in our homeland, living in[AN]
fear of encountering more and more[N]
of Arxhat's search parties.[A]

[MR]#Horus:
But we have to! The moment we[N]
show ourselves, he'll send[AN]
the full might of the Seraphyn[N]
army upon us![A]

[ML]#Vergil:
My point is that what we're doing[N]
doesn't solve anything. We've[AN]
crossed blades with his cronies[N]
multiple times already, and with[AN]
each confrontation, we lose more[N]
and more morale. All we're doing[AN]
is delaying our deaths.[N]
I'm sick of it.[A]

[MR]#Horus:
In that case, what would you suggest[N]
we do, Lord Vergil? We can't just[AN]
surrender, or exile ourselves to[N]
Novingale or Hevursa.[A]

[ML]#Vergil:
We take the fight to Arxhat. Look[N]
at what we've done to all these[AN]
search parties. We are more than[N]
capable of fighting him.[AN]

[MR]#Horus:
W-what? Pardon me?! The[N]
twelve of us, against the[AN]
rest of Seraphyn? Have you[N]
gone mad, my lord?![AN]

[ML]#Vergil:
I'm not suggesting that we lay[N]
siege to an entire country by[AN]
ourselves. Arxhat's rule is a[N]
controversial one. Many of our[AN]
people refuse to accept his bid[N]
to rule Seraphyn. The people[AN]
will inevitably support us.[AN]

[MR]#Horus:
If that's the case, where[N]
do we go, then? The capital?[AN]
With a bunch of peasants[N]
behind us?[AN]

[ML]#Vergil:
...Not yet. Bruckner was a fool,[N]
but how many more of my people[AN]
might believe Arxhat's lies?[N]
Traitors are one thing, but a[AN]
simple man believing what he is[N]
told can be even more dangerous.[AN]
I must show my people that they[N]
have been deceived. We, the Purple[AN]
Jaguars, must show them Arxhat's[N]
true colours.[AN]

[MR]#Horus:
Just as stubborn as your parents,[N]
but just as inspiring as they were,[AN]
huh. Heh. You've swayed my opinion,[N]
Vergil. I'll join your conquest.[AN]

[FFL]#Tray (offscreen):
Verg- Lord Vergil![A]

#Vergil warps to [Right]. Load Tray [MidLeft].
[MR][Clear][ML][Clear][Right][LoadVergil][ML][LoadTray]

#Tray:
I heard the entire thing. Please,[N]
let me join in too! Arxhat...[AN]
he was responsible for the deaths[N]
of my brothers. I must avenge them.[AN]
I may be young, Lord Vergil, but[N]
please, allow me to stand by your side![AN]

[Right]#Vergil:
Glad to see that your zeal[N]
has returned. Of course I'll[AN]
let you join in this crusade.[N]
What about the others?[AN]

#Clear Tray. Load Xenith [MidLeft].
[ML][Clear][LoadXenith]
#Xenith:
We share the same sentiments you do,[N]
Your Highness. Glac, Myst and I,[AN]
we might not be from Seraphyn, but[N]
for the rightful king, we will fight[AN]
with you until the bitter end.[AN]
[Clear]

#Clear Xenith. Load Myst [MidLeft] and Glac [FarLeft].

[Left][LoadMyst][FL][LoadGlac]
#Glac:
Mhm. We're not letting Arxhat[N]
destroy your homeland, what[AN]
your family worked so hard[N]
to build.[AN]

[Left]
#Myst:
We'll go to the capital and[N]
teach him a lesson he won't[AN]
forget! Because he'll be[N]
dead by then, of course![AN]
[Clear][FL][Clear]
#Clear Myst and Glac. Load Daff [MidLeft].

[ML][LoadDaff]
#Daff:
Still, do be careful! I can't[N]
watch over all of you![AN]

#Clear Daff. Load Sme [MidLeft].

[Clear][ML][LoadSmeglinde]
#Sme:
I-I'm not sure if I can be of much[N]
help, but... I'll try my best![AN]

#Clear Sme. Load Stephen [MidLeft] and Kabby [FarLeft].

[Clear][FL][LoadKabby][Left][LoadStephen]

#Stephen:
Now this is an unexpected[N]
development! But I, Stephen[AN]
Redharr, will remain a stalwart[N]
supporter of your cause![AN]

[FL]
#Kabby:
Eheh... of course I'll join[N]
you too, milord Vergil. My...[AN]
objective remains incomplete.[A]

#Clear Stephen and Kabby. Load Khris [FarLeft] and Anton [MidLeft].

[FL][LoadKhris][Left][LoadAnton]

#Anton:
As you can see, Lord Vergil,[N]
you have many trustworthy[AN]
allies for the long road ahead.[AN]

[FL]
#Khris:
We won't let him trample over[N]
the people of Seraphyn.[A]

[Right]#Vergil:
Thank you all, my friends. Before[N]
we start picking up momentum, we[AN]
have to free some of our loyalist[N]
friends from imprisonment. Anton,[AN]
do you have an idea where our[N]
allies are kept at?[AN]

[Left]#Anton:
If I'm not wrong, the resistance[AN]
force I was in contact with is[N]
locked up at Fort Theronca.[AN]

#Clear Khris. Load Horus [FarLeft].
[Clear][FL][Clear][LoadHorus]

#Horus:
Theronca... that's nearby our[N]
current location. It's not a[AN]
big fort, either. It's the[N]
ideal choice for our first...[AN]
grand reveal.[AN]

[Right]#Vergil: 
I see. Purple Jaguars! At dawn[N]
tomorrow, we march to Fort[AN]
Theronca! Let the liberation[N]
of Seraphyn begin![A]

Talk Conversations
Tray and Xenith
Load Tray [Left].

Tray: ... 

Load Xenith [MidRight].

Xenith: Tray. What bothers you?

Tray: Huh? #[Tray moves to MidLeft]
 AAH! What?!

Xenith: Hey, calm down! It's just me! I'm not some bear!

Tray: ...Ah. That's fortunate. Why did you sneak up on me like that, anyway?

Xenith: Your face troubles me. You used to be the most energetic and lively person we had. After that incident, however... are you sure you can take on Arxhat's men like this?

Tray: Oh. That. Really, it's nothing, Xenith. Just leave me be. ...You wouldn't know anyway. You didn't lose anyone that day.

Clear Tray. Xenith moves to [Right].

Xenith: Tray, wait! ...I'll have to keep watch on that boy.

Daff and Smeglinde
Load Daff [MidLeft] and Sme [MidRight].
Daff: Sme? If I may... Stay behind me, if you want. I'll watch out for you!

Sme: Hm? It's... it's not necessary. Really! I feel all better no-- ouch!

Daff: C'mon, silly! I, um... I mean... 
#[Daff moves to Left] Be honest with me, I wouldn't mind helping you out. Not at all!

Sme: I-I'm sorry... I can't be dead weight, is all. What's going to happen if I lose all my value to the Jaguars? #[Closes eyes] I'd like to avoid such thoughts...

Daff: You're ACTUALLY going to be dead weight if you keep pushing yourself to unhealthy and dangerous degrees. Please, it's alright! We all need help sometimes... I'm not the best judge of character, but... y-you, um... shouldn't be afraid to speak up! You're invaluable to us! What would we do if something terrible happened to you...?

Sme: #[Opens eyes]
I... I don't really understand, but I'll try to keep your words in mind. It'd be... disrespectful otherwise. And... Daff? Thank you.

Stephen and Horus (Only after the bear starts moving - so start of Turn 3)
Load Horus [MidLeft].

Horus: #[Eyes closed]
I can't look like a fool in front of Lord Vergil... I need a scapegoat for that failed plan! How about... Glac! Ah, yes! He came up with that godforsaken plan!

Stephen enters from off-screen to [MidRight].

Stephen: Aha! Getting ahead of the situation, Horatio?! A wondrous idea!

Horus:
#[Opens eyes, jumps in place]
 Wha-?! Oh, it's just you, thank goodness. Also, it's Horus.

Stephen: Oh, your horse is named Horatio too? Lovely! A great name!

Horus: ...please go after that bear... and die.

Stephen: That seems like a grizzly death! But it's alright! I couldn't bear for my new friends to get hurt! Like you, Horatio!

Clear Stephen.

Horus: #[closes eyes] ...Pretty sure one casualty should be fine in these times of war.

Khris and Stephen (inputted by Levin)
Load Stephen [MidLeft] and Khris [MidRight].
Stephen: What's this? another mercenary skulking about in this cave? Prepare yourself, villain!

Khris: I'm afraid you're mistaken here... I'm not an enemy!

Stephen: I see, a clever ruse... that's just what an enemy would say!

Khris: If it was a ruse, I would silence you right that instant.

Stephen: Your blade is fast... but I won't let you harm a hair on Prince Vergil's head!

Khris: I work for Vergil too. You seem to be strong, what say we spar later, after we take care of these soldiers?

Stephen: Oh, yes! You seem a worthy ally then... For Vergil, for Seraphyn and the Redharrs!

Clear Stephen.

Khris: Uh, ok...? Whatever suits you, I guess.

Myst and Glac (placeholder)

Load Myst [MidLeft] and Glac [MidRight].

Myst: Glac, you're as weak as usual. You're struggling against these grunts.

Glac: Yeah, sure, I may be struggling. But who's the one that did your jobs these past few days?

Myst: ...You?

Glac: Yup. You haven't put in any effort yet, and you're judging me? Tch. I'm tired of talking to you.

Clear Glac.

Myst: Hey, get back here! You let me threaten you into submission! #[Myst moves to Left] It was consensual!
