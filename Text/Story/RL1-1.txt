## RL1Narration
The Novingale Empire.[N]
A proud and well-faring nation[AN]
that has thrived for centuries.[N]
In recent years, the nation has[AN]
reached a peak of welfare, and[N]
its population has begun[AN]
exploding ever since. However,[N]
the increasing population[AN]
demands more space. The cities of[N]
Novingale are being overrun,[AN]
and disease has started to crop up[N]
over a lack of organization[AN]
and proper measures.[N]
Empress Aurea, current sovereign[AN]
of Novingale, seems to be[N]
turning the commonfolk's[AN]
suffering a blind eye. Her son,[N] 
Crown Prince Rodin, has taken[AN]
up arms to protect the commonfolk.[N]
Now, his duty takes him to the[AN]
territory of Count Alva, a[N]
decadent noble notorious for[AN]
leeching off his people...[A][X]

Is this the[N]
place, Boss?[A]
[MidRight] # Rodin
Yes. Alva territory is[N]
right around these[AN]
parts. Just a little[N]
further.[A]
[FarLeft][LoadKelly]
Milord, would you remind us[N]
what we've come to do here?[A]
[MidRight] #Rodin
We're here because we've been[N]
receiving complaints from the[AN]
townsfolk of Alva territory.[N]
From what I recall, Count Alva[AN]
has been extorting his people[N]
by levying absurdly high taxes[AN]
and overworking them.[A]
[Left] #Eric 
And since your dear mother[N]
turned them a blind eye,[AN]
you decided to come invest-[N]
igate for yourself. Right?[A]
[MidRight] # Rodin 
Right. That is why we've[N]
come to Alva's lands.[AN]
I'd like to confirm[N]
these claims for myself.[A]

It's terrible... Bandits are[N]
'ere to plunder our lands[AN]

Won't you please come drive[AN]

Rest assured. We shall[N]
eradicate those pillagers[AN]
and protect what is[N]
rightfully yours.[A]
[MidRight] #Villager
Oh, thank you, Your Highness![N]
If there's anythin' I can do to-[AN]
[Left] #Rodin
No need for recompense.[AN]
I am simply doing my duty[N]
as Prince of Novingale.[A]

My liege, your[N]

[Left] #Rodin
Everyone! Move out, and[N]
protect your fellow[AN]

bandit attack! Show[AN]
those wretches no mercy![A][X]

## BorgasCombat
[MidLeft] Grrr... Lord Alva didn't tell us we'd be facin' this much headwind! Dammit, s'pose I'll just get rid o' ya lot![X]

## BorgasVsRodin
[MidLeft] Th-the Prince?! Why aint'cha in yer little palace frolickin' about like a prince should?!
Rodin: Harm my countrymen, and you invoke my ire. Now, as your Prince, it falls to me to decide your fate. Brace yourself![X]

## BorgasDeath
G-guh... Wh-why'm I... seein' things...[X]

## RL1Ending
Villager (L): Thank you! Oh, thank you so much for savin' us from those ruffians!
Rodin (R): It sets me at ease knowing I could intervene in time.
Villager: If there's anythin' we could do to return the favor, please don't hesitate to give us a holler, Your Highness!
Rodin: Your well-being is reward enough for me. That being said, something seemed off about those bandits...
Michael (L): They were too organized for any ordinary bandit group, milord. If anything, they remind me of a militia, if an informal one.
Rodin: Well observed, Michael. Now, let's take matters to Alva. It's high time this madness was put to a screeching halt.
Michael: You've heard the prince, everybody. Let us be on our way.

Kelly (R): What an awful display that was...
Qua (L): I agree. Though I don't think there's much we can do against it.
Kelly: I know Lord Rodin is counting on us. I know we're valuable to him. Still, seeing all that bloodshed makes me wonder just how often this has happened.
Qua: It'd be so much more convenient if people didn't have to claw at each other. Oh, well... Let's join the others, Kelly.
Kelly: Right.[X]
