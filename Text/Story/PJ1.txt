## PJ1Narration
The Kingdom of Seraphyn. Ruled by[N]
the von Siegfried family for[AN]
centuries, the Kingdom has enjoyed[N]
an era of peace and prosperity.[AN]
However, recent events have[N]
roused up disdain among the people.[AN]
To the west, the Novingale Empire[N]
has been conducting frequent border[AN]
skirmishes, deploying numerous[N]
troops to that region, but Seraphyn's[AN]
current monarch, King Curtis, has[N]
done little to address Novingale's[AN]
aggression. Under pressure from his[N]
advisors, Curtis has requested an[AN]
audience with Aurea, current sovereign[N]
of Novingale. He brings along his son,[AN]
Prince Vergil, hoping that the[N]
experience will help educate him on[AN]
negotiating with other countries...[A][X]

#Horus:
[Left]
Prince Vergil, how are you[N]
faring? It must be exhausting,[AN]
having to travel all the way[N]
to Highwater Bridge.[A]


#Vergil:
[MR]
It's alright, Horus. You need[N]
not worry about me. I can manage[AN]
for the rest of the trip.[A]

#Daff:
[FL]
Still, you look weary, milord.[N]
Rest is important every now and[AN]
then, you know.[A]

#Vergil:
[MR]
Well, I would be lying if I said[N]
I wasn't half nervous. It's nothing[AN]
I can't manage, however.[A]

#Daff:
[FL]
Oh, I see... very well then, milord.[N]
I'll go and check on the others, too.[A]

#*Daff leaves*
[Clear]

#Horus:
[Left]
Still, Daff has a point, Lord Vergil -[N]
you must take care of your health.[AN]
You have an important role in the[N]
new trade agreement with Novingale,[AN]
yes? We have to make sure that you're-[A]

[FFL][LoadTray]

#*Tray barges in*
[MoveLeft]

#Tray:
GOOD LUCK LATER, VERGIL! I KNOW[N]
YOU CAN DO IT- I, uh... mean...[AN]
Prince Vergil...? ...Milord?[A]

#Horus:
[Right]
Ahem. If Tray's here, Sme should[N]
be coming any second now...[A]

#*Sme enters*
[FL][LoadSmeglinde]
#Sme:
Tray! Get back here this instant![N]
How many times have I told you[AN]
to behave appropriately in front[N]
of the Prince?[A]

#Tray:
[Left]
Umm... I'm... sorry?[A]

#Vergil:
[FarRight]
Hah - you don't have to be such a[N]
stick in the mud, Smeglinde. The[AN]
Kingdom isn't in its best state at[N]
the moment. Tray's enthusiasm and[AN]
positivity is much needed in such[N]
trying times. You have my thanks.[A]

#Sme:
[FarLeft]
But still, I think all of us would[N]
rather have our ears working after[AN]
this long excursion.[A]

#Tray:
[Left]
I'm still confused, Vergil- I mean,[N]
Prince Vergil. Why are you with us,[AN]
instead of your family?[A]

#Vergil:
[FR]
I would rather be here, Tray. My[N]
parents are a stern lot - being[AN]
around them wouldn't be too[N]
healthy for me. And besides,[AN]
Orion's there with your brothers.[N]
They're the most loyal of men we have.[AN]

#Tray:
[Left]
Oh, right, my big brothers! One day,[N]
I'll be just like them, and stand[AN]
by your side as a royal knight![A]

#Vergil:
[FR]
Well, I'm sure you will, Tray. I can[N]
tell you have the same zeal as them.[A]

#Tray:
[Left]
Ooh! I can see Highwater Bridge![N]
Oh, the bridge brings back[AN]
good memories. I remember when[N]
I was young, I-[A]

#*thump*

#Horus:
[Right]
What the- what's with[N]
the sudden stop?[A]

#Sme:
[FL]
Aah! T-There's enemies ahead![A]

#Vergil:
[FR]
What?! Are my parents alright?[N]
Quickly! To arms![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadFace][0x54][0x01]#some random portrait, placeholder Runa

[MR]#Runa:
Sir Yanndahl, I presume?[A]

[ML]#Yanndahl:
And... you are?[A]

[MR]#Runa:
Let's just say we're "help"[N]
sent by your benefactors.[A]

[ML]#Yanndahl:
Ah, wonderful. So, you know[N]
your men are serving under my-[A]

[MR]#Runa:
Do not get ahead of yourself,[N]
Sir Yanndahl. Now, if you[AN]
would, send your men to cut[N]
off the caravan's escape[AN]
routes here. My unit is more[N]
than capable of holding off[AN]
the other side.[A]

[ML]#Yanndahl:
...Hmph. Your units better not[N]
hold us back, girl. Besides,[AN]
shouldn't they be focusing[N]
on the royal caravan?[AN]

[MR]#Runa:
Don't worry about that.[N]
We'll carry out this[AN]
mission flawlessly.[N]
Now, you'd better pick[AN]
up the slack on your[N]
side. It isn't much[AN]
time before the Dark[N]
Prince's men start to[AN]
show up.[A]

#*Runa leaves.*
[Clear]

[ML]#Yanndahl:
Gah, who does that brat think she[N]
is, doubting me? We're plenty[AN]
good enough to handle some brat[N]
prince and his riff-raff gang.[AN][X]

## PJ1OpeningAttack
#*open to map. Vergil and other PJ units deploy from the caravans.*

[MR][LoadVergil]
#Vergil:
What is going on here?! Damned[N]
ruffians, as Prince of Seraphyn,[AN]
I'll never forgive you if you[N]
lay so much as a finger on the[AN]
other caravans![A]
[Clear]

#Xenith:
[FR]
Seems we're surrounded. Get[N]
into formation, lads! Our[AN]
objective: Protect the Prince![N]
Let's get to work![AN]

#Myst:
[Right]
Finally, some entertainment. I was[N]
getting bored just sitting around[AN]
standing on guard. Glac, you'd[N]
better stay out of my way.[AN]

#Glac:
[Left]
Yeah, yeah, jeez. Just shut[N]
up and get going.[A]

#Daff:
[FL]
Oh, my. Are you three really alright?[N]
I know I asked you earlier, but now,[AN]
with all these-[AN]

Does man care?[A]

Does man care?[A]

[FL]#Horus:
Lord Vergil, our best bet here[N]
is to aim for the commander[AN]
leading these brutes before we[N]
head off to help the others.[A]

[Left]#Vergil:
Good thinking, Horus! Everyone![N]
Let's make quick work of these[AN]
ruffians and aid the other[N]
caravans ahead![A]
#MAP STARTS
[X]



## PJ1Turn2PlayerScene

Vergil:
Who are these men?! Their[N]
skills are much greater than[AN]
a mere mountain bandit![A]

Horus:
Let's not fret over such[N]
details for now, Lord Vergil -[AN]
I already have a scheme[N]
planned out for this. Just[AN]
stick to my plan for now.[A][X]

## PJ1Turn3EnemyScene
Yanndahl:
This isn't good... boys![N]
Get over here! We need[AN]
some more men![A][X]

## PJ1Turn5EnemyScene
Yanndahl:
How are those pipsqueaks[N]
still alive? Looks like[AN]
it's time for me to step[N]
in. Show 'em what you've[AN]
got, boys![A]
YANNDAHL NO LONGER REMAINS STATIONARY.
[X]


## PJ1YanndahlCombat
Yanndahl:
So my men couldn't handle[N]
you, huh? Then I'll finish[AN]
the job myself![A]

Vergil vs. Yanndahl: 

Vergil:
Yanndahl!? What is the meaning[N]
of this treachery? You are[AN]
sworn to serve the rulers[N]
of Seraphyn![A]

Yanndahl:
That's a question you won't[N]
get the answer to, princeling.[AN]
All you need to do is say[N]
your last words... and die.[A]

Yanndahl Defeated:

Yanndahl:
Gah! That hurts like hell...![N]
Boys, we're getting out of here![A]


Ending:

(ONLY IF YANNDAHL WAS NOT DEFEATED)

Yanndahl:
Bah, I'm sick of this little game.[N]
Boys, we're leaving! We've held[AN]
off the princeling's little band[N]
long enough. I'm not dying just yet.[A]

(END OF BRANCH)

Vergil:
They're retreating! Quickly,[N]
everyone! Let's head off to[AN]
the royal caravan![A]

------

Sme:
It's worse than I thought...[A]

Daff:
Oh, gods... the knights and[N]
the servants, they're all... [A]

*Daff faints*

Sme:
Daff? DAFF! Someone, help me[N]
out here! Daff collapsed-[A]

Tray:
Hold it! I think I see a bunch[N]
of people! Is that... Orion?[A]

*camera moves up to Runa and Orion.*

Runa:
And that's that. The Tyrant[N]
King has been felled.[A]

Orion:
Y-You... you monster! You do know...[N]
you aren't doing anything good[AN]
for "the future of Ternon", do you...?[A]

Runa:
Hmm? You're still alive? You're[N]
a good man. I'll give you two[AN]
options - flee, or perish here[N]
with the rest of this lot.[A]

Orion:
His Majesty and Her Highness...[N]
THEY WILL BE AVENGED![A]

*EVENT BATTLE BETWEEN RUNA AND ORION. ORION MISSES, AND RUNA RETALIATES WITH A CRIT.*

Orion:
Argh! I'm... I'm sorry,[N]
your majesty... [A]

Runa:
So in the end, you're just like[N]
the rest of them - brainwashed[AN]
by the devilish von Siegfried[N]
family. How pitiful.[A]

Orion:
Do not insult... their names...[N]
long live... Prince... Vergil![A]

Runa:
That's enough of you.[A]

*Runa yeets Orion off the bridge*

Runa:
Now, how does our[N]
princeling fare?[A]

*The PJs arrive at the scene.*

Vergil:
Father, Mother... Damn those[N]
assassins! I'll cleave their-[A]

Horus:
Vergil, hold! We're at[N]
risk as it is! Don't[AN]
make matters any worse![A]

Vergil:
Horus, shut up! How could you[N]
say that? Look at what they[AN]
did to my family! My flesh and[N]
blood! Do you think they'd[AN]
want us to just leave this be?![N]
What sort of "plan" involves[AN]
LEAVING MY PARENTS ROTTING[N]
ON THE GROUND?![AN]

Runa:
Hmm? The princeling is still alive,[N]
is he? I had low expectations of[AN]
Yanndahl, but he's somehow managed[N]
to disappoint me. Oh well, I'll[AN]
have to take matters into my hands.[A]

Glac:
This sure went from bad to[N]
terrible really quickly.[AN]
I think this is the part[N]
we run.[A]

Xenith:
This is bad! Everyone! Grab[N]
whoever you can and RUN!![A]

*Myst tries grabbing Vergil*

Myst:
Oi! Settle down! We need[N]
to get out of here![A]

Vergil:
I... I... Rrgh![A]

*Clear Vergil*

Xenith:
You! Scout the area ahead for the[N]
safest pathway! We're breaking[AN]
through to safety.[A]

Tray:
...my brothers, they're all... Horus,[N]
please... tell us what to do.[A]

Horus:
Tray, we can mourn later. We've[N]
all lost something precious today,[AN]
but we need to keep living more[N]
than anything. Now GO![A]

Tray:
...Got it, Horus.[A]

*some people get rescued and they all run offscreen*

Runa:
Hah. You made the right choice,[N]
Dark Prince. How smart of you.[AN]
Though, for how much longer[N]
can you escape our judgment?[A]

------

*Nighttime, in a nearby forest*

Vergil: ...

Daff:
What in gods' name just transpired...?[N]
Oh, why can't we return to those[AN]
normal relaxing days once more...[A]

Myst:
Whatever it was it sure as hell[N]
was nasty. I'd count ourselves[AN]
lucky we managed to get this[N]
far without pursuit.[A]

Glac:
Sooo... Where are we heading[N]
now? Kinda bored from all[AN]
this traveling.[A]

Horus:
We ride to the capital. If[N]
we travel through the night[AN]
at our current pace, we[N]
should be back by dawn.[AN]
Continue pushing on, everyone.[A]

Xenith:
Those two don't seem to be[N]
doing too well. You sure we[AN]
shouldn't rest up for a bit?[A]

Horus:
That's not an option. It'd be far[N]
too dangerous considering the[AN]
recent events. If we don't keep[N]
running, we're as good as dead.[A]

Sme (offscreen):
Aaagh![A]

Glac:
...What was that?[A]

*sme appears*

Sme:
Ugh... E-enemies![A]

Horus:
Sme, you're bleeding![N]
What happened?![A]

*Seraphyn soldiers appear*

Arxhat Soldier:
Is this Prince Vergil's band?[A]

Vergil:
...Yes, it is. ...Are you[N]
here to escort us back?[A]

Arxhat Soldier:
Former prince Vergil of Seraphyn.[N]
I hereby declare to you a death[AN]
sentence for the murder of the[N]
former king and queen.[AN]
...King Arxhat's orders.[A]
