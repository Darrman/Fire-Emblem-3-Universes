## PJ1Narration
The Kingdom of Seraphyn. Ruled by 
the von Siegfried family for
centuries, the Kingdom has enjoyed
an era of peace and prosperity.
However, recent events have
roused up disdain among the people.
To the west, the Novingale Empire
has been conducting frequent border
skirmishes, deploying numerous
troops to that region, but Seraphyn's
current monarch, King Curtis, has
done little to address Novingale's
aggression. Under pressure from his
advisors, Curtis has requested an
audience with Aurea, current sovereign
of Novingale. He brings along his son,
Prince Vergil, hoping that the
experience will help educate him on
negotiating with other countries...


Opening scene:

Horus:
Prince Vergil, how are you
faring? It must be exhausting,
having to travel all the way
to Highwater Bridge.


Vergil:
It's alright, Horus. You need
not worry about me. I can manage
for the rest of the trip.

Daff:
Still, you look weary, milord.
Rest is important every now and
then, you know.

Vergil:
Well, I would be lying if I said
I wasn't half nervous. It's nothing
I can't manage, however.

Daff:
Oh, I see... very well then, milord.
I'll go and check on the others, too.

*Daff leaves*

Horus:
Still, Daff has a point, Lord Vergil -
you must take care of your health.
You have an important role in the
new trade agreement with Novingale,
yes? We have to make sure that you're-

*Tray barges in*

Tray:
GOOD LUCK LATER, VERGIL! I KNOW
YOU CAN DO IT- I, uh... mean...
Prince Vergil...? ...Milord?

Horus:
Ahem. If Tray's here, Sme should
be coming any second now...

*Sme enters*

Sme:
Tray! Get back here this instant!
How many times have I told you
to behave appropriately in front
of the Prince?

Tray:
Umm... I'm... sorry?

Vergil:
Hah - you don't have to be such a
stick in the mud, Smeglinde. The
Kingdom isn't in its best state at
the moment. Tray's enthusiasm and
positivity is much needed in such
trying times. You have my thanks.

Sme:
But still, I think all of us would
rather have our ears working after
this long excursion.

Tray:
I'm still confused, Vergil- I mean,
Prince Vergil. Why are you with us,
instead of your family?

Vergil:
I would rather be here, Tray. My
parents are a stern lot - being
around them wouldn't be too
healthy for me. And besides,
Orion's there with your brothers.
They're the most loyal of men we have.

Tray:
Oh, right, my big brothers! One day,
I'll be just like them, and stand
by your side as a royal knight!

Vergil:
Well, I'm sure you will, Tray. I can
tell you have the same zeal as them.

Tray:
Ooh! I can see Highwater Bridge!
Oh, the bridge brings back
good memories. I remember when
I was young, I-

*thump*

Horus:
What the- what's with
the sudden stop?

Sme:
Aah! T-There's enemies ahead!

Vergil:
What?! Are my parents alright?
Quickly! To arms!

*Scene changes to the bridge ahead, fields background*

*Yanndahl appears on the screen. Runa approaches him.*

Runa:
Sir Yanndahl, I presume?

Yanndahl:
And... you are?

Runa:
Let's just say we're "help"
sent by your benefactors.

Yanndahl:
Ah, wonderful. So, you know
your men are serving under my-

Runa:
Do not get ahead of yourself,
Sir Yanndahl. Now, if you
would, send your men to cut
off the caravan's escape
routes here. My unit is more
than capable of holding off
the other side.

Yanndahl:
...Hmph. Your units better not
hold us back, girl. Besides,
shouldn't they be focusing
on the royal caravan?

Runa:
Don't worry about that.
We'll carry out this
mission flawlessly.
Now, you'd better pick
up the slack on your
side. It isn't much
time before the Dark
Prince's men start to
show up.

*Runa leaves.*

Yanndahl:
Gah, who does that brat think she
is, doubting me? We're plenty
good enough to handle some brat
prince and his riff-raff gang.

*open to map. Vergil and other PJ units deploy from the caravans.*

Vergil:
What is going on here?! Damned
ruffians, as Prince of Seraphyn,
I'll never forgive you if you
lay so much as a finger on the
other caravans!

*The caravans attempt to escape to the right, only to be cut off by the sudden appearance of Yanndahl and his men, and are killed.*

Xenith:
Seems we're surrounded. Get
into formation, lads! Our
objective: Protect the Prince!
Let's get to work!

Myst:
Finally, some entertainment. I was
getting bored just sitting around
standing on guard. Glac, you'd
better stay out of my way.

Glac:
Yeah, yeah, jeez. Just shut
up and get going.

Daff:
Oh, my. Are you three really alright?
I know I asked you earlier, but now,
with all these-

Myst:
Does man care?

Glac:
Does man care?

*Clear Myst and Glac*

Daff:
Um. Be careful, I guess...?

*Clear Daff*

Horus:
Lord Vergil, our best bet here
is to aim for the commander
leading these brutes before we
head off to help the others.

Vergil:
Good thinking, Horus! Everyone!
Let's make quick work of these
ruffians and aid the other
caravans ahead!

MAP STARTS

Turn 2, Player Phase:


Vergil:
Who are these men?! Their
skills are much greater than
a mere mountain bandit!

Horus:
Let's not fret over such
details for now, Lord Vergil -
I already have a scheme
planned out for this. Just
stick to my plan for now.

Turn 3, Enemy Phase
Yanndahl:
This isn't good... boys!
Get over here! We need
some more men!

Turn 5, Enemy Phase
Yanndahl:
How are those pipsqueaks 
still alive? Looks like 
it's time for me to step
in. Show 'em what you've
got, boys!

YANNDAHL NO LONGER REMAINS STATIONARY.

Boss Quote: 

Yanndahl:
So my men couldn't handle
you, huh? Then I'll finish
the job myself!

Vergil vs. Yanndahl: 

Vergil:
Yanndahl!? What is the meaning
of this treachery? You are
sworn to serve the rulers
of Seraphyn!

Yanndahl:
That's a question you won't
get the answer to, princeling.
All you need to do is say
your last words... and die.

Yanndahl Defeated:

Yanndahl:
Gah! That hurts like hell...!
Boys, we're getting out of here!


Ending:

(ONLY IF YANNDAHL WAS NOT DEFEATED)

Yanndahl:
Bah, I'm sick of this little game.
Boys, we're leaving! We've held
off the princeling's little band
long enough. I'm not dying just yet.

(END OF BRANCH)

Vergil:
They're retreating! Quickly,
everyone! Let's head off to
the royal caravan!

------

Sme:
It's worse than I thought...

Daff:
Oh, gods... the knights and
the servants, they're all... 

*Daff faints*

Sme:
Daff? DAFF! Someone, help me
out here! Daff collapsed-

Tray:
Hold it! I think I see a bunch
of people! Is that... Orion?

*camera moves up to Runa and Orion.*

Runa:
And that's that. The Tyrant
King has been felled.

Orion:
Y-You... you monster! You do know...
you aren't doing anything good
for "the future of Ternon", do you...?

Runa:
Hmm? You're still alive? You're
a good man. I'll give you two
options - flee, or perish here
with the rest of this lot.

Orion:
His Majesty and Her Highness...
THEY WILL BE AVENGED!

*EVENT BATTLE BETWEEN RUNA AND ORION. ORION MISSES, AND RUNA RETALIATES WITH A CRIT.*

Orion:
Argh! I'm... I'm sorry,
your majesty... 

Runa:
So in the end, you're just like
the rest of them - brainwashed
by the devilish von Siegfried
family. How pitiful.

Orion:
Do not insult... their names...
long live... Prince... Vergil!

Runa:
That's enough of you.

*Runa yeets Orion off the bridge*

Runa:
Now, how does our
princeling fare?

*The PJs arrive at the scene.*

Vergil:
Father, Mother... Damn those
assassins! I'll cleave their-

Horus:
Vergil, hold! We're at
risk as it is! Don't
make matters any worse!

Vergil:
Horus, shut up! How could you
say that? Look at what they
did to my family! My flesh and
blood! Do you think they'd
want us to just leave this be?!
What sort of "plan" involves
LEAVING MY PARENTS ROTTING
ON THE GROUND?!

Runa:
Hmm? The princeling is still alive,
is he? I had low expectations of
Yanndahl, but he's somehow managed
to disappoint me. Oh well, I'll
have to take matters into my hands.

Glac:
This sure went from bad to
terrible really quickly.
I think this is the part
we run.

Xenith:
This is bad! Everyone! Grab
whoever you can and RUN!!

*Myst tries grabbing Vergil*

Myst:
Oi! Settle down! We need
to get out of here!

Vergil:
I... I... Rrgh!

*Clear Vergil*

Xenith:
You! Scout the area ahead for the
safest pathway! We're breaking
through to safety.

Tray:
...my brothers, they're all... Horus,
please... tell us what to do.

Horus:
Tray, we can mourn later. We've
all lost something precious today,
but we need to keep living more
than anything. Now GO!

Tray:
...Got it, Horus.

*some people get rescued and they all run offscreen*

Runa:
Hah. You made the right choice,
Dark Prince. How smart of you.
Though, for how much longer
can you escape our judgment?

------

*Nighttime, in a nearby forest*

Vergil: ...

Daff:
What in gods' name just transpired...?
Oh, why can't we return to those
normal relaxing days once more...

Myst:
Whatever it was it sure as hell
was nasty. I'd count ourselves
lucky we managed to get this
far without pursuit.

Glac:
Sooo... Where are we heading
now? Kinda bored from all
this traveling.

Horus:
We ride to the capital. If
we travel through the night
at our current pace, we
should be back by dawn.
Continue pushing on, everyone.

Xenith:
Those two don't seem to be
doing too well. You sure we
shouldn't rest up for a bit?

Horus:
That's not an option. It'd be far
too dangerous considering the
recent events. If we don't keep
running, we're as good as dead.

Sme (offscreen):
Aaagh!

Glac:
...What was that?

*sme appears*

Sme:
Ugh... E-enemies!

Horus:
Sme, you're bleeding!
What happened?!

*Seraphyn soldiers appear*

Arxhat Soldier:
Is this Prince Vergil's band?

Vergil:
...Yes, it is. ...Are you
here to escort us back?

Arxhat Soldier:
Former prince Vergil of Seraphyn.
I hereby declare to you a death
sentence for the murder of the
former king and queen.
...King Arxhat's orders.

*screen fades to black*
