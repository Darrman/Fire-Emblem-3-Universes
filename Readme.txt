TALE OF TERNON
DEMO 1

How to play:
1. Download and run NUPS.
2. Apply the .ups file to a clean FE8 rom.
3. Enjoy.

About the hack:
Set on the land of Ternon in 1153, Tale of Ternon tells the tale of the Empire
of Novingale, the Kingdom of Seraphyn, and the Republic of Hevursa. Follow
the story of one of three routes: Rodin’s Crimson Wolves, Vergil’s Purple
Jaguars, and Elle’s Amber Bears, and watch how their actions will shape the
future of Ternon.

There are three different routes available for the player to choose. Each is
planned to be fifteen chapters long. This demo has the first three of each
route available, with a total of nine chapters available to play.

Known issues:
All known issues can be referenced on the project's GitHub page. The most
severe issue is that the text is largely placeholder in Purple Jaguars 3 and
Amber Bears 2 and 3. The chapter gameplay is completely present, however.
Minor graphical issues also appear in some menus. This does not affect the
game in any significant way.
